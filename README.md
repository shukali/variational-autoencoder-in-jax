# Variational Autoencoder in JAX
This is an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder in JAX, trained on MNIST data. The model uses a simple NN build in Flax, optimization is implemented in Optax. The notebook also nicely highlights some features of generative models, namely
* generating MNIST digits
* linear interpolation of class tokens
* predicting the image, given only the top half

Details are explained in the notebook. In case of questions, feel free to reach out!
